# BFNet
A high-performance Brainf*ck interpreter with unlimited 16-bit memory cells (obviously as long as you have enough RAM) written in C#, with a nod to my failed previous attempt [here](https://github.com/cainy-a/MindMangler).

16 bits should be the most you'll need.
I considered using 64-bits to make it more efficient for CPUs to deal with,
but decided that it was inefficient.
